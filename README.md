### MyClients-ReactJs

Website where a registered user will be able to store the information of their clients.
This information will be private for each user who publishes it.
In addition, the user will be able to delete, search or edit the records that he previously made in the website.
The difference between this version and the [first version](https://github.com/MartinLaRosa27/MyClients-ReactJs) of the application is that in this version, I use GraphQL for the database queries.
The frontend of the application is made with React.js.
The backend is made with Node.js, and the data is stored in a MongoDB database. For the database queries it is going to be used GraphQL.

### Used Technologies

HTML / CSS / Bootstrap V5 / JavaScript / React.js / Redux / Next.js / Node.js / GraphQL / ApolloServer / MongoDB / Mongoose / Cookies / Consume API
