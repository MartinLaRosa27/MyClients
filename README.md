### MyClients-ReactJs

Web application where a registered user will be able to store the information of their clients.
This information will be private for each user who publishes it.
In addition, the user will be able to delete, search or edit the records that he previously made in the website.
The difference between this version and the [first version](https://github.com/MartinLaRosa27/MyClients-ReactJs) of the application is that in this version, I use GraphQL to strore all the information, and perform the API queries.

### Used Technologies

HTML / CSS / Bootstrap V5 / JavaScript / React.js / Redux / Next.js / Node.js / GraphQL / ApolloServer / MongoDB / Mongoose / Cookies / Consume API REST
